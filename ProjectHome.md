The project aims to get more stuff recycled by making it easier to find items offered via a mailing list, such as Freecycle.

By parsing the contents of incoming mail, a structured database can be maintained and presented via a web interface.  This offers many potential benefits, e.g.

  * hiding offers that have been taken.
  * triggering alerts.
  * highlighting poster behaviour.
