* add wanteds
* LATER
* use pear paginator
* define official start date to remove access to dev data

* extract yahoo page link
* link back to yahoo page.
*  showpost.php for a full view on an item: linked posts, posts since (if offered) or posts prior (if taken).  Note start date of database.

NOTES
* set up /area/b17 using mod-rewrite for future community plans
* get brumcycle.com domain?
* Have hacked PEAR DB in by placing DB.php, DB and MDB2 directly in working dir.  Had trouble getting CLI on correct path.  Use php.ini
* Can always do a freecycle stats page.
* Writing monolithic text logs slows processing to a crawl.
* Top 10 offerers list is potentially motivating
* Idea: you can only use freecycle list if you've posted an offer!
* Adding explicit taken list since it's non-trivial to always match up offers, e.g.  taken all my offers over past week thanks b14
* Can release yahoo addresses, redirect to post page via rich email scraping, or...
* being able to search for untaken items beyond last few days boost chances of finding/shifting something(?)
* Will need to be sure of scalability if general user base adopts it!
* Passion for this project staggers a bit after noticing most users are from northfield/quinton way
* ToS issue:  ultimately should migrate away from Y!groups if this is a real issue.  Motivation for the admins comes from making their lives EASIER.  This can be by providing automatic post templates, filtering and historical notes.  If they ultimately remain reactionary and we are still motivated then we can only infiltrate and bypass.  We can prompts user adoption by raising awareness, eg, via google ads, mail sigs, etc.  Even having a word with Bloggers and gettinf the story in the Post.  From the perspective of the modsquad the only real problem is invalid posts - they are fighting the good fight.
* * It's possible to make useful tools without reproducing content, as an index e.g. stats, search linked directly back to source, stats for named member, etc.
