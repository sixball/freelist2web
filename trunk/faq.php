<h2>Connecting 'Offered' and 'Taken' posts</h2><a name="linking">
The system tries to work out if an offered item has been taken.  It does this by comparing looking for later 'taken' posts from the same e-mail and comparing the subject headers.  If they loosely match then it connects them and marks the item as taken.  It's not a perfect solution because possible differences in spelling or sender address.  This is why the 'taken' list is also included: it includes many posts for which the original offer cannot be found.

<h2>What about privacy?</h2>
Although the database records the email of each poster, we only show the part before the @ symbol.  There are different domains after the @ (and this also how Yahoo! handles privacy on the web).
