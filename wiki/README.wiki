= Intro = 

This project is designed to mailing lists that are suffering under the strain of their own success.  In this case there is an abundance of offers and takers but the medium is not working effectively to make the connection.  This system allows a list to continue to use the method they are familiar with but with the extra advantage of custom functionality.

WARNING: the first version was hacked up as a very quick proof of concept.  The code is shameful and has organically spewed various features and changes.  By putting it up here, I'm motivated to tidy it up with the nice byproduct of learning SVN hosting on Google.

= To Do =
