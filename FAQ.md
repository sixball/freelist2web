# If mailing lists suck why build on top of them? #
There are some excellent completely web2.0 apps such as [Reyooz](http://reyooz.com) out there but they don't yet have the critical mass of established mailing lists.  People use them because everyone else is using them.  This creates a limiting self-reinforcing loop that Freelist2web aims to break out of.

# Are you trying to take over Freecycle? #
We think the Freecycle Network is doing a great job of raising awareness of the possibility of reuse of unwanted items, made possible by the tireless work of an army of moderators given for free. With this open-source script are trying to maximise the effect of their work by making it easier for the offered item to find a taker.

# How do you protect privacy? #
